# Howdy! I'm Teo, great to meet you :wave:

I build production ML systems at scale by any means necessary.

* Sometimes this means getting in the weeds wrangling raw data; training and evaluating models; or setting up super
  reliable, low-latency, high-throughput highly-observable online/offline ML feature and model serving systems.
* Other times this means sitting in meetings with business, product, and technical stakeholders from all corners of the
  company, as well as partners and colleagues across the industry, to define the right problems to tackle and the right
  things to build.
* No matter what, it always means listening to the people we're serving, making sure we're solving the most important
  problems, and thinking beyond what's possible to what is actually needed to add the most value to our customers.

I'm currently focus-firing all of the above as a Staff Machine Learning Engineer at [Mercari](https://jp.mercari.com/),
Japanâ€™s largest C2C e-commerce marketplace, to support the world-class AI teams and applications across the company.
